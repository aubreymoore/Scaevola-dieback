# The Bark Beetle Attacking Guam's Nanasu Plants Has Beem Identified

Experts at the University of Florida have identified the tiny bark beetle which is attacking Guam's nanasu plants, 
also known as beach naupaka or by its scientific name, **Scaevola taccada**. Nanasu is a major component of the beach strand 
community on Pacific Islands where it is also used as an ornamental landscaping plant. Ironically, this same plant species is 
considered to be an invasive species in Florida and the Caribbean.

The beetle was identified as **Hemicryphalus argutus** by Andrew Johnson, a graduate student working in Dr. Jiri Hulcr's lab in 
Gainesville, Florida. Johnson is the world's leading taxonomist in a huge group of tiny bark beetles known as Cryphalini, 
or the pygmy borers.  The identification was based on specimens collected from dead and dying nanasu plants used in ornamental 
hedges throughout Tumon Bay during an investigation of a problem which is being called **Scaevola** dieback.
